Thanks for taking the time to come here! As a first step towards the development of Genestorian, we are developing [ShareYourCloning](https://github.com/manulera/ShareYourCloning), a web application to generate molecular cloning strategies and share them with others. You can contribute to the project in many ways:

 * ðŸ§¬ **As a researcher (potential user)** you can provide feedback on the usability of the tools, ask for new features, or simply share how you think they could be integrated into your workflow.

 * ðŸ’» **As a developer** you can jump right into the code! Check the issues in the in the [main](https://github.com/manulera/ShareYourCloning/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+), [backend](https://github.com/manulera/ShareYourCloning_backend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) or [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/ShareYourCloning_frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) repos.

 * ðŸ’»+ðŸ§¬ **As a researcher with some programming knowledge** you came to the right place! ShareYourCloning was started as a side project of a researcher, and you can use it as a way to get started with contributing to Open Source. Even if you have no experience in web, you can still make important contributions to the project.


You can visit the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/manulera/ShareYourCloning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository.
