# What is Genestorian?

Genestorian is an Open Source web application that allows researchers to document collections of model organism strains and recombinant DNA.

# Documenting genetic engineering

Genestorian stores your collection of strains and recombinant DNA in a relational database.

It records the genetic engineering steps followed to generate new entities from existing ones.

Sequences of new entities are generated _in silico_ from sequences in your local collection or sequences retrieved from genome databases.

# Share

The database schema of Genestorian can be exported to json format.

This can be converted into graphical diagrams or text describing your cloning strategy. These can be shared with colleagues and collaborators, and used in publications.

# Demo of the prototype

Genestorian is at a very early stage of development.

Here is a demo of a prototype of Genestorian. If you have some ideas or feedback, please [send an email](mailto:genestorian@gmail.com).
