# What is Genestorian?

Genestorian is an Open Source web application that allows researchers to precisely document cloning and genetic engineering operations performed with recombinant DNA and model organism strains.

# Documenting genetic engineering

Genestorian documents and stores your collection of strains and recombinant DNA, promoting sequence traceability.

It does so by generating new recombinant DNA and allele sequences _in silico_ from sequences in your local collection or genome databases.

# Demo of the prototype

Here is a demo of a very early-stage prototype of Genestorian. If you have some ideas or feedback, please [send an email](mailto:genestorian@gmail.com).
