If you are here, you may be interested in doing an internship working on Genestorian.

You may not know know much biology, but don't worry! An internship with us can also be an opportunity for you to learn about the fascinating world of genetics and genetic engineering. Here are some basics to understand the use-case we are trying to address.

## Key concepts in Genetics for research

### Genetics: why?
**Genes** are sequences of DNA that encode information to produce important biological molecules: RNA and proteins ([read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology)). These molecules are involved in cellular functions like generating energy, duplicating the genetic material, or moving cells and their components. Virtually all cellular processes involve a protein or RNA encoded by a gene.

**Genetics** is a branch of biology that uses a series of techniques to modify the DNA sequence of organisms (**genetic engineering**) in order to study **gene functions**. A classic genetic experiment is to remove the entire sequence of a gene from an organism and study the consequences of the absence of this gene. Processes that are perturbed when a gene is missing point to its **gene function**: the function of the RNA or protein encoded by the missing gene. Other gene modifications are possible. For example, DNA fragments can be removed from a gene to understand the function of the specific part of a protein encoded by that fragment. Another example is adding a marker DNA sequence to a gene so that the encoded protein becomes visible in a microscope. Such genetic modifications produce new **gene variants, known as alleles**.

Certain species are frequently used in research, and are known as **model organisms**. Popular examples are the bacteria *E. coli* and the baker's yeast *S. cerevisiae*.  For a certain model organism, several genetic variants exist, known as **strains**. An important concept in genetics is the concept of **wild-type strain**, a “normal” genetic variant of that organism for which the sequences of all genes are known. When a genetic modification is made in the wild-type strain, the resulting new strain is characterised by its **genotype**, which lists the non-wild-type **alleles** present in that new strain. For example, if we remove the gene named ase1 in a yeast wild-type strain, the genotype of the resulting new strain will be "ase1Δ" ("Δ" means that the gene has been removed).

### Genetics: how?

That's all great, but how do you edit the DNA of an organism? For this, we use **recombinant DNA**, molecules of DNA that exist outside of cells and can be manipulated in the lab. There are multiple techniques that allow us to generate a desired DNA sequence, but they tipycally eiher combine pieces of existing recombinant DNA molecules or add small modifications. So every molecule of DNA always comes from another one. We could, for example combine two pieces of existing **plasmids** (circular DNA) to generate a new plasmid (see below). A way to this is by "cutting and pasting" the pieces of interest using **restriction enzymes** (scissors in the figure), molecules that cut the DNA at specific sequences.

Once we have our desired sequence, we can insert it or replace a fragment in the genome of an organism using **genetic engineering** methods.

## The problem we are solving

### What you can do during your internship
<!-- 


 Accessing allele sequences or tracing back the origin of a certain DNA fragment inserted in the genome, if possible at all, is laborious, unreliable, and depends on the documentation provided by previous researchers.

One laboratory working on a model organism like yeast for around ten years can easily have a collection of around 10,000 strains, created by researchers in the lab or received from collaborators. The inventory of these collections is typically kept in a spreadsheet. This is prone to errors and inconsistency because the data is input manually. Additionally, as genetic engineering becomes more sophisticated, it becomes increasingly hard to reduce a complex genetic modification to a self-explanatory word, like "ase1Δ", so the exact modifications are described in a non-standardised way. Most model organisms can be sexually crossed, which means that new strains are generated by mating of existing strains. This results in alleles from the parents being also present in the children. The ancestry of a strain and the origin of the alleles contained in it, is only recorded within a laboratory's spreadsheet. Therefore, when a strain is published in a scientific journal or sent to a collaborator, the strain ancestry or the origin of its alleles is often lost. With hundreds of laboratories working on different model organisms, millions of strains used to study embryonic development, cancer, ageing, and other biological processes are stored in a non-standardised way that is not accessible to researchers outside the laboratory that created them and can become confusing even for the laboratory that created them.

We will develop Genestorian, a web application that allows researchers to document the methods used to produce strains, and record the changes with respect to the reference gene sequence in a standardised way. This information will be stored in a relational database, where a link will exist between the resources used to generate the strain and the strain itself. This will allow researchers to quickly access the ancestry and progeny of a strain, and to know in which strains an allele is present, the sequence of the allele, and how it has been created. Genestorian will also allow exporting this information in a standardised manner to be readable by computers and incorporated into databases with minimal human supervision. Genestorian will thus facilitate the reproducibility, exchange and interpretation of genetic research by tracing results to specific DNA sequences.  -->
